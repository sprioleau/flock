 * Prompt layer (b) — tool guidance, generated from the SDK's action registry.
 * Plan §3.2 / §9.3: descriptions come from the registry, never hand-written
 * here, so this layer can't drift from the actual tool surface.
 *
 * CACHEABLE: pure function of the registry — for a given build of the SDK the
 * output is byte-identical on every request. Assemble it immediately after
 * SYSTEM_STATIC so Gemini's implicit caching covers both static layers as one
 * stable prefix. Registry registration order is preserved (deterministic).
